Lightweight but rich data grid with re-sizable columns and a scrolling data to match the headers, plus an ability to connect to an XML or JSON data source using Ajax to load the content.

Similar in concept with the Ext Grid only its pure jQuery love, which makes it light weight and follows the jQuery mantra of running with the least amount of configuration.

New onError event on ajax interaction, (it will pass what the server said in a variable called data), allowing you to handle server problems
New $().flexAddData method, allows you to directly add new data to the grid using your own data source.
New preProcess API, allows you to modify or process data sent by server before passing it to Flexigrid, allowing you to use your own JSON format for example.
Single Rows Select just use { singleSelect: true } in the options

Many more
One of my main goal for the plugin is ultimately to keep it lightweight!
