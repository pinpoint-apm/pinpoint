## Pinpoint RxJava Plugin (beta)

### RxJava 1.x Configuration
RxJava plugin is disabled by default and for [release](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint/blob/master/agent/src/main/resources-release/pinpoint.config) profile until the beta status is lifted. To enable, set the following option in *pinpoint.config*:
```
profiler.rxjava=true
```

### RxJava 2.x Configuration
We currently do not support RxJava 2.x. This will be added in the future.
