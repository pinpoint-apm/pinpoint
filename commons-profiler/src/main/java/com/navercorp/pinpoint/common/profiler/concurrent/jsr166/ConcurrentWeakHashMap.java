/**
 * A hash table with <em>weak keys</em>, full concurrency of retrievals, and
 * adjustable expected concurrency for updates. Similar to
 * {@link java.util.WeakHashMap}, entries of this table are periodically
 * removed once their corresponding keys are no longer referenced outside of
 * this table. In other words, this table will not prevent a key from being
 * discarded by the garbage collector. Once a key has been discarded by the
 * collector, the corresponding entry is no longer visible to this table;
 * however, the entry may occupy space until a future table operation decides to
 * reclaim it. For this reason, summary functions such as <tt>size</tt> and
 * <tt>isEmpty</tt> might return a value greater than the observed number of
 * entries. In order to support a high level of concurrency, stale entries are
 * only reclaimed during blocking (usually mutating) operations.
 *
 * While keys in this table are only held using a weak reference, values are
 * held using a normal strong reference. This provides the guarantee that a
 * value will always have at least the same life-span as it's key. For this
 * reason, care should be taken to ensure that a value never refers, either
 * directly or indirectly, to its key, thereby preventing reclamation. If weak
 * values are desired, one can simply use a {@link WeakReference} for the value
 * type.
 *
 * Just like {@link java.util.ConcurrentHashMap}, this class obeys the same
 * functional specification as {@link java.util.Hashtable}, and includes
 * versions of methods corresponding to each method of <tt>Hashtable</tt>.
 * However, even though all operations are thread-safe, retrieval operations do
 * <em>not</em> entail locking, and there is <em>not</em> any support for
 * locking the entire table in a way that prevents all access. This class is
 * fully interoperable with <tt>Hashtable</tt> in programs that rely on its
 * thread safety but not on its synchronization details.
 *
 * <p>
 * Retrieval operations (including <tt>get</tt>) generally do not block, so
 * may overlap with update operations (including <tt>put</tt> and
 * <tt>remove</tt>). Retrievals reflect the results of the most recently
 * <em>completed</em> update operations holding upon their onset. For
 * aggregate operations such as <tt>putAll</tt> and <tt>clear</tt>,
 * concurrent retrievals may reflect insertion or removal of only some entries.
 * Similarly, Iterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the state of
 * the hash table at some point at or since the creation of the
 * iterator/enumeration. They do <em>not</em> throw
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}. However, iterators are designed to
 * be used by only one thread at a time.
 *
 * <p>
 * The allowed concurrency among update operations is guided by the optional
 * <tt>concurrencyLevel</tt> constructor argument (default <tt>16</tt>),
 * which is used as a hint for internal sizing. The table is internally
 * partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates
 * without contention. Because placement in hash tables is essentially random,
 * the actual concurrency will vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to
 * accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using
 * a significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a
 * significantly lower value can lead to thread contention. But overestimates
 * and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not usually have much
 * noticeable impact. A value of one is appropriate when it is known that only
 * one thread will modify and all others will only read. Also, resizing this or
 * any other kind of hash table is a relatively slow operation, so, when
 * possible, it is a good idea to provide estimates of expected table sizes in
 * constructors.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class and its views and iterators implement all of the <em>optional</em>
 * methods of the {@link Map} and {@link Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>
 * Like {@link Hashtable} but unlike {@link HashMap}, this class does
 * <em>not</em> allow <tt>null</tt> to be used as a key or value.
 *
